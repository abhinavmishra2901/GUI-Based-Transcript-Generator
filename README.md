# Transcript Generator | _Python, FPDF2, Streamlit_
- Built an app to generate Transcripts (Result Sheet) in PDF format from raw CSV data.
- Raw data included details of students, courses, grades and results.
- The content placement was determined dynamically, based on the number of semesters and courses.
- FPDF2 was used for generating and filling the pdf, and Streamlit was used to create a frontend.
